# Python Socket Attack Simulation

This script demonstrates a basic implementation of a simulated socket-based attack using multithreading in Python. It continuously sends requests to a target IP and port, simulating high traffic. This example is for educational purposes only.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**This script is intended solely for educational purposes to understand how network requests and socket programming work. Misusing this script to perform unauthorized attacks, including DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), is illegal and punishable under various laws. Always ensure you have permission to test against a specific target.**

## üìù Description

The script:
- Creates a socket connection to the target IP and port.
- Sends HTTP GET requests with a fake IP address.
- Uses multithreading to create multiple simulated clients.
- Includes error handling and a short delay to avoid overwhelming the system.

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Modules used:
  - `socket`
  - `threading`
  - `time`

Install Python and ensure the required modules are available in your environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Socket Setup**:
   - A socket is created using `socket.AF_INET` (IPv4) and `socket.SOCK_STREAM` (TCP).
   - Connects to the specified target IP and port.

2. **Request Sending**:
   - The script sends a malformed HTTP GET request to the target.
   - Uses a fake IP address (`fake_ip`) for the `Host` header.

3. **Multithreading**:
   - 500 threads are spawned to simulate multiple clients sending requests simultaneously.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If a `socket.error` occurs, it prints an error message and continues execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Execution

1. Clone or download this script to your local system.
2. Replace the `target`, `port`, and `fake_ip` variables with appropriate values:
   - `target`: IP address of the target system.
   - `port`: Port number to connect to (e.g., `80` for HTTP).
   - `fake_ip`: A fake IP address used in the `Host` header.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
